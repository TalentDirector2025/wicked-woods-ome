Dj Polar has always been involved with music in some capacity, early on learned on the piano, sang in choirs or in the school bands. 

Polar started spinning down at the local roller rink in Calgary on a dual CD player, then onto some vinyl, then onto a couple of different software packages, and medias. And still is fluent enough to go between them flawlessly. 

Once Polar caught the DJ bug, he has never looked back!

When it comes to DJing, he always has and always will keep playing something different, never in the same order, or the same sound.
