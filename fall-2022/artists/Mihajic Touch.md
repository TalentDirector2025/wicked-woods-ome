Groove has been in this girlâ€™s heart since 1998 when Tracy Mihajic danced her way into the electronic music scene. Joining the Golden Delicious Crew in 2002, Dj Mihajic Touch has shaken the dance floor with her unique blend of all things house music ever since. This maven of the night has the ability to read a party like no other and will bring your crowd to both the deep and dirty depths of a great Bassline and the ecstatic frenzied peak that every dancer craves. Good fortune smiles upon her in Golden with its rich music scene, and DJ Mihajic Touch has awakened parties on home ground as well as festivals across BC and Alberta, such as Shambhala, Motion Notion, Burning Man, Wicked Woods, Fozzy Fest, and many more.
