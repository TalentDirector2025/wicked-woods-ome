Originating from Treaty 6 Territory, this Queer Caribbean Clown is a multifaceted performer whoâ€™s skills will leave you both excited, nervous & wondering how in the hell she did that. 

With a wide range of skills, CallMeKeeks brings her 10+ years of African Dance, burlesque & prop manipulation to the centre stage of all her performances. From music videos & stages across Canada, the USA & South America she is sure to leave you gasping for more. 

Devilish & divine, with a hint of femme fatale energy, this cute little clown is ready to play, no matter the day.
