FuBaR*D - is a DJ/Producer from the Kootenays. After stepping back from doing live performances to deal with personal matters and addiction issues in 2016, he never really stopped working on music and has since uncovered a Deep and Dark side. An alter-ego with a new type of vibe and a different look depending on the mood. 
Now he is returning to decks with a whole new inspiration and drive that you surly don't wanna miss.
