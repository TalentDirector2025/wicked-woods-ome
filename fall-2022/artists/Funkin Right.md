FunkinRight is all about fun and funky party music, and having a good time.
A high energy DJ with a new found passion for making funky bangers, FunkinRight has
released over 20 tracks since 2019, including 2 EPs and several official releases and remixes
on labels like Breakbeat Paradise, Render Recordings, Wildfire Records, and B Nasty Beats.

When FunkinRight isn’t funking up dance floors with his funkin funky beats, he’s promoting
music and keeping the Funk alive through his Calgary-based music promotion company, Dojo
Entertainment. Through promoting, performing, and partaking in music, FunkinRight has shared
the stage with many of his own inspirations including Askillz, Featurecast, Father Funk, JFB,
Megan Hamilton, Phibes, WBBL, Woofax, X-Ray Ted, and has had the privilege of playing some
amazing events including Bizarre, Curiosity, FozzyFest, Freezerburn, Vibrant, and more.

It’s about living right, loving right, and treating people right. It’s about doing what you love, with
the people you love to do it with, and always (always) staying funky. FunkinRight brings good
vibes wherever he goes and wherever he plays, no matter the genre, no matter the stage.
Stay Funky My Friends!
