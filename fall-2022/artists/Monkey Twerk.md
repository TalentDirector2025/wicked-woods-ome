A happy-sexy-dirty blend of Electronic Party Music. Adriana & Frank, originally from Colombia, legally from Canada, and happily in Amsterdam, always run on good vibes, have a serious commitment to partying, and love making the fun happen.

Influenced by Latin percussion, Canadian basslines, and European grooves, their sets are a combination of different types of house music catered perfectly for each occasion, and are loaded with dancing vibes to make different kinds of crowds shake their bodies like there's no tomorrow.

Their experience and music taste have taken them to play music festivals in Canada, UK and Costa Rica, boat parties in Amsterdam and Dubai, and private parties all around the world.
