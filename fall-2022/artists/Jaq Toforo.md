Jaq Taforo plays piano and his solo set meanders through a mix of jazz, lounge and dub using a keyboard synth and looping pedal to layer sounds and beats. Originally from Mt Shasta, California, Jaq now resides in Nelson and has performed across the kootenays in a number of groups and styles. When he's not playing music or playing in the mountains, you can usually find him brewing beer with Nelson Brewing Co.
