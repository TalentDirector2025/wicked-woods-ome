After moving to Calgary in 2013 from the West Kootenay region of BC, E-LeV-8 pushed himself to be a part of the Drum and Bass scene. He joined Philthy City early in 2017 and shortly after was offered a role in the RunniT Productions crew shortly after. Since then, he has played countless club shows, bush raves, and festivals (including Wicked Woods) in Western Canada, and has made a name for himself amongst his peers. 

With a major arsenal of all styles of Drum and Bass, his high energy sets are always unique, and sure to get any dancefloor he performs at to be elevated to their pinnacle.
