Established in 2013, Le Cirque de la Nuit is Western Canadaâ€™s leading Circus and performing arts organization based in Calgary, Alberta. Specializing in innovative performance productions that provide unique, exciting and immersive entertainment experiences for audiences while providing a supportive, collaborative artistic platform for emerging and established artists across Western Canada.

We create multi-dimensional performance experiences that entice and envelope the senses by merging the Circus arts with all elements of the performing arts, including choreography, theatrics, music, visual & special effects, set design, custom decor/props, makeup, costuming and more!

Over the past nine years, we have produced over 25 unique Cirque Nuit performance productions and performed at numerous corporate events, fundraising events, nightlife events, and festivals across Canada.
 
We take great pride in being a leader in our industry, as an advocate for our performing artists and the circus arts community as a whole here in Alberta and throughout Western Canada while always providing unique, alternative entertainment options for our audiences.
