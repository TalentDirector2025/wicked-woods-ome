Hailing from beautiful British Columbia/Yukon Territory, James (Zegend) has found himself sinking roots and putting in work in Edmonton, Alberta over the last decade. He has been a part of many projects, festivals, venues and start-ups around the city and has turned his focus more towards his music career this year.

Starting from a young musician learning and playing a mix of brass, percussion and string instruments, through school and a myriad of different bands, groups, and projects, Zegend has taken his musical background skills and knowledge and funneled it towards electronic music. 

Gathering influences from a plethora of different styles or music, Zegend has come up mixing many different genres and has nested himself comfortably in the realm of 140/Dub/Grime/Trap primarily. Technical transitions and FX blending mixed together with live beat-looping, scratching, live drumming or a combination of them all lends to a different experience each time.
