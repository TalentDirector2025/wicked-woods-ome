Based out of Canmore, Smirk brings a blend of low end sounds to the dance floor. You can expect Deep Dubstep, Halftime and DnB with drips of Grime, Hip-Hop and Rap throughout his sets. As an original member of the Local Wild Life Collective, Smirk has been a mainstay at LWL events and continues to grow and contribute to the Rockies bass music scene
