Kiana, aka keekz, started her journey in 2018 by taking electronic music production classes at Night Vision Music Academy in Edmonton, Alberta. Fast forward a few years and you can find keekz utilizing that knowledge of rhythms & patterns to showcase the perfect balance of intricate drums, soul-shaking bass, original productions (team Ableton), & powerful, female influences during one of her diverse sets.

When sheâ€™s not making people dance, keekz is curating events with the legendary Umbral Sound System in Edmonton-a new collective she has co-founded with a few talented individuals that saw the need for inclusive & community-focused parties (featuring some big-ass, custom speakers).
