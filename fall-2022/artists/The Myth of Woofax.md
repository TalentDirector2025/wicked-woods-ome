Combining an all-original music mix with a self-written and professionally narrated short horror story, this audio aims to alter the paradigm of the traditional music mix. A lone character stumbles upon the secrets of a haunted mansion in this short ghost story. The tale is backed by the dark electronic soundscape of Woofax’s album made especially to compliment the narrative.

As well as being an electronic writer, producer and international performer, Woofax is also a celebrated mixing and mastering engineer. His diverse list of clients include The Funk Hunter's Westwood recordings, the GRAMMY award winning artists The Crystal Method, and an extensive list of heavy bass music artists. He helped engineer many songs from the beginning of Dillon Francis’ career and consulted and assisted mastering on Excision “Codename X” album. He also works closely with the internationally acclaimed loudspeaker company PK sound. WOOFAX is here to bring awesome music of all sorts to old and new friends alike with skills, style and energy.
