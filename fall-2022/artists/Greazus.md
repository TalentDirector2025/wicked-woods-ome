When longtime friends, and well-established producer/DJs HxdB and Patrik Cure decided to join forces as
GREAZUS back in 2015, they knew that their collective power would be greater than the individual. Based on
their collective experience running their record label, Aufect, and throwing several parties and events in the
Vancouver-area, they already had a great synergy working together. It has been this synergy that is the
bedrock and vision behind the newly founded Triple A Agency, of which the two are founding directors. Their
tireless work ethic, shared passion and love of music has been distilled into their music and performances and
is a big factor in their success on and off stage.
GREAZUS’ musical output is a blend of many influences, including Jungle, Drum & Bass, Hip Hop, Grime and
Footwork. Boasting releases on top labels like Hospital Recordings, Tru Thoughts and Critical, plus
underground heavyweights Diffrent, Vandal and Deviant Audio plus their own imprint, Aufect. Their recently
released album “Golden Hour” displays their adept nature working with vocalists, and operating at multiple
BPMs skillfully. They are renowned for collaborating with other producers like: Fixate, Sinistarr, Shield, Abstrakt
Sonance, Doctor Jeep, HomeSick and BSN Posse. Plus they have worked alongside vocalists like: Redders,
MC Irah, Killa P, D Double E, Sammy Rich and Magugu.
They have performed at top international festivals like Outlook (Croatia), Lightning in a Bottle (USA) and
Bamboo (Costa Rica). In Canada, they're considered crowd favorites at Shambhala and Bass Coast, drawing
massive crowds on multiple stages. They have received support from huge artists like Noisia, Truth,
Machinedrum, Alix Perez, Youngsta, dBridge, J:Kenzo, Sam Binga, Om Unit, Ivy Lab, Kasra and more.
