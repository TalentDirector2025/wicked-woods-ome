At the age of sixteen, Distinct (Samantha Makeiff) was a little young to be getting into the electronic scene, but a series of events had started to show her the way. Starting her DJing career from there, it wasnâ€™t long until she was out purchasing her first pieces of vinyl. Due to an extensive musical background it was only a matter of time before she was dabbling in more than house music, spinning a variety of other genres including drum and bass, breaks, and ghetto funk. Her versatility and ear for top notch electronica has landed her multiple gigs across Canada.

Eager to share her music and support her local scene, Distinct has involved herself with a plethora of local Calgarian production and show crews. Helping bring some of the biggest names into Calgary has proven to be a busy and encouraging use of time, with lots of time also going to pursuing production. With musical releases under her belt, an already extensive festival circuit, and a dream to conquer the world, there is no stopping this ball of DnB fire. This is only the beginning of a very promising career.
