Residing in Alberta, Canada, Gremmah is a DJ best known for mixing heavy hitting, grungy dubs that are fuelled with UK grime. She also loves to blend in reggae roots and is exploring a more eclectic variety of sounds. Along with her live performances, you can catch her spinning as a Resident DJ with Aaja Music (a radio station, record label and event space in Deptford, London). She is proud to have guest mix features on Mode London, CJSW 90.9FM, CJSR 88.5FM and Sub Chakra Radio. 

Gremmah is part of the Umbal Sound System family and has performed with her crew, United Bass Kollective, Mahsi Fellowship, Borealis Music Festival and Motion Notion Music Festival. Some of her recent highlights include opening for Khiva, Abstract Sonance and Distinct Motive.

She has always had a strong connection with music and dancing. From a young age she was a hip hop dancer competing across Alberta. She has great respect for old school hip hop, reggae music, sound system culture and pirate radio. This influences her taste in music and drives her to learn more about these cultures everyday.
