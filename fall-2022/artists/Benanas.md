Benanas has been a presence in the Calgary Electronic music scene for over a decade now, promoting, hosting and performing at most of his city’s best venues. With a track pool deeper than an Olympic high dive, his unique blend of Bass music, Hip-Hop, Funk and everything in-between crafts a vibey flow that has kept crowds moving at festival such as Wicked Woods, Fozzy Fest, LEMF, Forest Awakening, Circle Carnival, Vibrant and many more for years.

These festival slots and his long history in Calgary’s electronic music scene have earned him bookings in many towns and cities across Alberta and British Columbia. At the dawn of the Covid Pandemic, Benanas had a tour lined up with some of his closest musical peers, with dates in Vancouver, Naniamo, Golden, Fernie, Nelson, Calgary, Edmonton, and Saskatoon. Ever since the tour was cancelled, he’s been grinding in the studio with his keyboards and MPC, cooking up beats of his own and releasing them on his new Record label, Dumpster Fire Records. Bananas is a seasoned DJ who can easily read a crowd’s vibe and give them what they didn’t even know they needed.

There are four things you’re sure to get when seeing a Benanas set: Great vibes, fresh turntablism, tasty acapellas and of course, that sweet, sweet potassium.
