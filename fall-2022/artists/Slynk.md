Naturally gifted with a musical ear, Evan aka Slynk flirted at first with a range of classical instruments including piano, guitar and drums, but it's when he started experimenting with sampling and sound design that the wheels were ultimately set in motion.
Starting his careers in an underground New York inspired caf√© in his original hometown of Brisbane, Australia, to his first International appearance at Shambhala's Fractal Forest, in 2009, continues to refine his skills, experimenting and educating himself and his fans with mash up productions of classic hip hop, ingrained with rare and funky, rhythmically savvy grooves.
