Joanna Magik is a Canadian DJ and producer with an energetic stage presence and releases on some of today’s most influential house music labels; Box of Cats, Glasgow Underground and Gene Farris’ Farris Wheel Recordings. Her live sets cover all genres of house music and have captivated crowds at Canada’s largest dance music festivals including Badlands, Chasing Summer (2021 and 2022) and Shambhala Music Festival (2022). She makes her Rifflandia debut in 2022. Joanna Magik was selected to support American house-music phenom JWorra on the Canadian stops of her 2022 ‘Check Out’.

She’s part of the Femme House Collective, founded by LP Giobbi and Hermixalot, regularly streaming live on Twitch to raise awareness of under-represented genders in dance music. Her background as a professional athlete and sports announcer (including the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games) explain her big energy and advocacy for health and movement.
