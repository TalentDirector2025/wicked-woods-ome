Residing in Calgary, AB, HNH aka Hannah Abramski began her dive into the electronic music community in 2015 as an attendee. Hannah's DJ journey began as a simple bonding activity with her partner Cody. Cody, a DJ for another crew in Calgary, and Hannah share a passion for 140 and Drum & Bass, which led Cody to teach Hannah how to DJ. 

Frequently visiting Calgary's infamous Hifi Club and Habitat Living sound introduced her to a wide variety of sounds and genres. This ultimately led her to join Sub Chakra, a local crew with a focus on sound system culture. In 2017, she discovered her passion for techno after seeing local legend Esette perform at Hifi during the Alberta Electronic Music Conference. 

HNH draws inspiration from techno artists such as Charlotte De Witte, Enrico Sangiuliano, and Adam Bayer, along with her roots in 140.
