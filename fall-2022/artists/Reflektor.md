Since combining forces in 2015, Reflektor has been on the rise as theyâ€™ve stretched their roots across the West Coast of Canada and caught eyes within the global Drum & Bass circuit. As a duo, Alex Timmer and Alec Grose found their unique sound nestled in the deeper end of the spectrum while flaunting a smooth, soulful, and diverse style of Dnb.

With Alec leading the charge in their productions, the duo hit their stride in late-2018 with their exciting debut of 'Hold on Me Feat. Anastasia' on the mighty Shogun Audio. Leading into early-2019 they kept the ball rolling with their debut alongside Dave Owen on Technique Recordings, 'Undertow', as well as their two tracks, 'This Love Feat. Anastasia' and 'Run Forrest Run w. Low5', included on Technique Recordings' Summer LP 2019. Most recently, mid 2021 saw Reflektor's smooth liquid debut on Symmetry Recordings with the vocal aid of Leo Wood in 'Slow it Down' and has lead to current multiple 2022 releases on PAV4N's newcomer label Darkmode.
