Originally from the UK, Pete planted himself in The Canadian scene at a young age, organizing and DJing events led to a few of Calgary’s long running residencies. He made the natural move to production in early 2000s and with more than 20 years experience behind him, continues to tour the North American Festival Circuit during summer and studio hibernation during the long, cold winters of Canada, making tracks under his name as-well as his house/ garage alter-ego “Bungalow”
Most recently he co-founded a new label, Wildfire Recordings, as a sister label to UK Breakbeat powerhouse Diesel Records.
You can check out his many flavours of broken funk, funky house and lip biting garage
