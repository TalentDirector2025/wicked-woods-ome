Wes Please has worked incredibly hard to get to the level that he is at, and it shows. Not without its challenges, the journey has forced him to grow and adapt, leading to where he is at now, the height of his entertainment career. He powered his way through multiple festivals including Shambhala Music Festival in beautiful British Columbia Canada. And he's blown the roof off at countless club gigs with artists he truly looks up to. This has helped ground Wes Please in the BC Interior/West Coast electronic music scene. But he knows he wouldn't be able to do it without those close to him. The massive support from everyone at Footwerk, The Beatlab, the Fractal Forest crew as well as countless other supporters, individuals and fans help make any dream a reality. Always aiming higher, we canâ€™t wait to see what new heights Wes Please reaches from here.
