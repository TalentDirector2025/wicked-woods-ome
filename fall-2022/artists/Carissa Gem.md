Chances are if you’ve spent anytime in the festival scene in western Canada, this next artist needs no introduction. Carissa Gem, a BC native who literally grew up inside the rave, having been filling dance floors since before she was old enough to drive. 

Drawing on influences from artists like Barisone, The Librarian, Mad Zach, and Danny Scrilla, to expect the same thing twice from this powerhouse of an artist would be a mistake. Her sets range from the dark to the ethereal, but always featuring deep, rich bass and a heavy dose of ass shaking rap music to get the crowd going. 

A predominant figure and voice of the bass music scene in Calgary AB, where she has called home since 2015, Carissa spends her time honing her musical craft, hosting the wildly popular radio show What Will The Neighbours Think every Friday night on CJSW 90.9FM, and consistently looking to improve and nurture her love of music. In her spare time between festival bookings and local gigs you can find Carissa lending a hand to some of the best curators of western Canada’s deep soundscape culture, and swapping party planning tips with the upper echelon of festival culture. To say she’s a Gem would be selling her short, so you’ll just have to see it to believe it.
