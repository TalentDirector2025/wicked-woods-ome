With mentoring from some of Edmonton’s veteran producers, Oli quickly honed both his DJing and music production skills. What started as a love of rocking house parties has quickly turned into more than just a hobby with his recent addition as a co-host on CJSW’s What Will The Neighbours Think alongside Carissa Gem in Calgary, Alberta. 

His original productions and remixes come with his experience from Night Vision Music Academy under guru Jake Robertz. Whether curating for an opening slot, a wedding, a bachelor party, a radio show, or anywhere in between, Oli brings love and attention to his selections, always keeping fun in mind. Oli has opened for Keekz, Sorsari, Metafloor, and Greazus. 

Look for future Oli productions and DJ sets in your face and on your block.
