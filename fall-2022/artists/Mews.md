From the forest of the west coast of BC Mews was raised in the paws of festival culture, electronic and folk alike. Her passion for music was ignited at a young age and she always dreamed of being on stage. That dream came true when she played her festival debut for The Grove stage at Shambhala Music Festival. 
She has been shooting for the stars ever since.
Her sound is largely influenced by all types of bass music, predominantly coming from the UK along with r’n’b, hiphop, downtempo and nostalgic dance floor anthems from her youth. You can count on her to get your body moving.
You can find her nestled in the mountains of Nelson BC playing at restaurants, clubs and local events.
