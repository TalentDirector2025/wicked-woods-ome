Born and raised in Japan, Leo Zen developed at a young age an intense passion for all things Bass. Originally immersing himself in the production side of music, he quickly discovered a knack for creating solid, grungy, hard basslines, incorporating deep melodic undertones that purveyed a sense of subtle urgency and emotion. Seeking to expand his knowledge and co-create with his peers Leo made the decision to move to one of the bass capitals of the world, British Columbia, Canada. Upon arrival, Leo quickly carved out a reputation for delivering extremely high energy sets; consisting of original production, diverse mixing, captivating stage presence, and an uncanny timing that has annihilated dance floors from Canada to Costa Rica, and all over Europe. With releases on Really Good Recordings, Druid Recordings, and Aufect Recordings, he has solidified himself as one of the premier Drum nâ€™ Bass producer/DJ's in Western Canada. Always learning and growing Leo continues to use music as his tool to express his experiences, proving there are no boundaries, with the goal to elevate minds through sound.
