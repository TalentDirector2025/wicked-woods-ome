Captivate is a Vancouver based producer and DJ pushing deeply rooted yet forward thinking electronic music. The emerging artistâ€™s productions vary from dark, weighty and dubbed out halftime & footwork jungle hybrids, to introspective, ambient-infused bass music across the tempo spectrum. His tracks & DJ sets always pay homage to 90's rave music, fusing that influence with a more modern production ethos. His productions frequently appear in DJ sets from the likes of Om Unit, J:Kenzo, Doctor Jeep, Mat the Alien and other heavy hitters, and have been released on respected labels such as Mystic State's The Chikara Project and longtime mentor Stranjah's Deviant Audio imprint.
