Lion-S (aka Sara Spicer) is a name synonymous with West Coast House, Breaks, Bass and World music. A connoisseur for over 2 decades who still champions trends, her sets are calculated perfectly to suit the timeslot and vibe of the show.
Lush and worldly with a confident and feminine stage presence, Sara has curated and played parties coast to coast in Canada and worldwide.
Always the tastemaker, her company The Pride still curates the world-famous Living Room Stage at Shambhala Music Festival. She is also a founding member of Meow Mix, the all-female dj crew spanning
over 20 years.
Sara has recently released her first album as NurTur, her downtempo side project with collaborator and sibling ‘Birdriot’.
