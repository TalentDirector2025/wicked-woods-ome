BreO has been one of British Columbia’s leading female DJs since 2007. In the earlier years, BreO had established herself as vocalist, performing with Kelowna's all-girl DJ collective “FlyDJs”. Before her transition to turntables in 2007, BreO had performed vocally at a variety of club nights, festivals and charity events across British Columbia.

As a DJ, BreO has an arsenal of major accomplishments backing her name. These include 2 performances at Shambhala Music Festival (2011- DJ set at The Village Stage, 2013- Vocalist set with DJ Lyssa at the Nebula stage), opening set for Pendulum at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver (2009), Motion Notion (2012- PK's Cabana Stage) , Pirate Party (2017- Montana, USA), Bamboo Bass Festival (2016, 2017 and 2018 -Costa Rica) and headlining northern Canada's Paradise Electronic Music Festival (2017, 2018 and 2019- Yukon). Over the course of the recent pandemic, BreO adjusted to the changing times by turning her music focus to Twitch, the popular streaming platform. On Twitch, she became a resident DJ for Y Afterhours (Edmonton) and RaveHardRadio (Calgary) channels. She continues to stream regularly and has become an important member of the "Ladies On Decks" collective- which celebrates talented women across Canada and beyond.

Pre-pandemic, BreO has had the opportunity to be a direct opening act for heavyweight artists such as Aphrodite, Freq Nasty, Stickybuds, Pendulum, The Upbeats, AC Slater, Reid Speed, Defunk, Spectrasoul and more! 

If you have had the opportunity to catch BreO live or on Twitch, you know that her sets are diverse and include a variety of tempos and styles. Whether it's live vocals combined with the 4x4 rhythms of Deep House and UK Garage, booty shaking Breakbeats and Drum and Bass, BreO manipulates genres with flow and grace. 

Driven by her love for music and the dancefloor, this girl rocks a DJ set in proper STYLE. A set by BreO is not one to miss!
