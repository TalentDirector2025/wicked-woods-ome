PuppyCat is the spectral embodiment of light and dark, yin and yang, the
sun and the moon, the mind and the heart, and the magic that happens when they meet. A unifying force between Howl and MisfortuneCat melding minds and music. PuppyCatâ€™s passion for music spanning bpms and genres can be heard in their selections. Their sets ebb and flow beautifully between their unique
styles, exploring the deep rumbles of bass, rhythmic and syncopated
percussion, sparkly arpeggiated melodies of music made with emotion,
experienced with all of your senses. Watching their energy on stage you
can easily see and feel how they complement each other.
Both Howl and MisfortuneCat have been a part of the western Canadian
bass music scene for some time, with guest mixes out on Fat Kid On Fire,
Honey & Bass, SubChakra, Samsara Beats, and Abysmal Entities.
This duo has power and precision - no doubt big
things are in store.

You can find them in Harrop, BC.
