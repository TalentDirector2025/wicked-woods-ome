Originating from the Sunshine Coast, British Columbia, ethereal beatsmith Saturna has an artistic voice unlike any other. Saturna is a sonic story-teller who weaves layers of deeply emotive melodies and organic rhythms with cinematic flair. A lifelong musician, Saturna is dedicated to stitching together narrative threads into a tapestry of distorted synths, warm throbbing basslines and lush percussive elements. As the founder of Wildlife Division, Saturna is leading a collective of daring artists focused on pushing the boundaries through sound experimentation and live curation.
