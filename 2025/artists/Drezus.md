Drezus is a force in Indigenous hip-hop. An Anishinaabe/Nehiyaw artist based in
Mohkinstis, he blends raw lyricism with cultural resilience, crafting music that moves,
empowers, and inspires.
His journey started with Team Rezofficial, earning a JUNO nomination and multiple
Indigenous music awards. As a solo artist, his 2013 album Redwinter became a rallying
cry for the Idle No More movement, followed by Indian Summer, cementing his influence
in the scene.
Drezus has won major accolades, including the 2022 SOCAN Vince Fontaine
Indigenous Song Award, a 2017 MTV VMA with Taboo (Black Eyed Peas), and four
Indigenous Music Awards in 2015. He’s shared stages with hip-hop giants like Drake,
50 Cent, Mobb Deep, and The Black Eyed Peas, bridging Indigenous and mainstream
music worlds.
Beyond music, Drezus is making waves in film and TV, with appearances in Yellowstone
and contributions to powerful soundtracks. His latest release, Ballad of Bobby Jones
featuring Sebastian Gaskin, keeps his signature storytelling alive—unapologetic,
thought-provoking, and deeply rooted in his culture.
Drezus isn’t just music, he’s a movement.
