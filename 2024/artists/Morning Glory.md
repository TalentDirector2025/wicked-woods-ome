Nestled in the heart of the Kootenay region, DJ Morninglory draws inspiration from the natural beauty that surrounds her hometown. These influences, coupled with a global perspective, create a unique musical fusion that mirrors the diversity of Kootenay landscapes. As a proud member of the all-women DJ collective, Meow Mix, Morninglory joins forces with other sonic sorceresses to amplify the voices of women in the electronic music scene. Meow Mix is not just a DJ group; it's a movement dedicated to breaking barriers, shattering stereotypes, and creating spaces where women thrive and excel. DJ Morninglory's sets are an exploration of sonic landscapes, seamlessly transitioning between Tech's pulsating beats, Afro's rhythmic dance, and Deep House's soulful embrace. Each track carefully chosen, each mix a journey; Morninglory's performances are a testament to her mastery of the decks and her ability to create an atmosphere that resonates with the hearts of her audience.
