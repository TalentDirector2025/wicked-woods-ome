For over 20 years, Dragon Fli Empire have showcased their unique brand of conscious and melodic hip hop from their origins in Calgary to the world. DFE was formed in 2002 by William Aberhart High School graduates Adam Hicks (DJ Cosm) and Tarik Robinson (Teekay). They started turning heads with their anthem for the contemplative bus rider, Mount Pleasant which received significant traction on indie radio throughout Canada in the early 2000s. Their infectious, energizing live shows have rocked crowds in North America, Europe and South America. Their latest releases Banff Avenue and To Be Continued / Inspiration were released in the last two years to rave reviews and a new project to celebrate their 20th anniversary will be released later in 2022.
