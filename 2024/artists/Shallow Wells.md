Envisioning a complex cobweb of human expression, Kootenay local Shallow Wells (Nate O'Hearn & Darian Troy) represent the intersection along strands called POETRY, POST-HOP, THRASH-CORE, RAVE-ESQUE, EMOTION-CUMBERANCE, CREATIVE TOIL, and WORKMANSHIP. Although drawing on many influences, the music they produce remains torn between categorical tug-of-war. It happens as if I'm only acting as conduit, Darian explains, like it has a mind of it's own. I don't really get a say in how it comes out. Met with the support of sound-techs, poetry PhD's, creative writing teachers, DJ's & promoters, and the folk willing to discuss what the music meant to them, Shallow Wells continue their iceberg drift.  From Darian's verse in 'Avaritia Badges' : remember when yer bendin yer demographics/ that staying calm is causing nothing everyday/ beats of broken drums echo throughout the chasm/ of proprietary hollow hearts bearing hollow souls/ and dismantled mortified demoralized mortal minds/ but theres more to my earth than just the kamikaze tactical/ take me to the gallows pole/ put me on display/ gallery gallery gallery actual
