How innocent and unassuming, they all thought, the sonic union of Howl and MisfortuneCat. 
No one suspected the chaos their combined artillery would bring. That the incessant battering of bombs dropped at 140 bpm would rip apart the fabric of spacetime; and on the other side of that portal, PuppyCat emerged from the wreckage. In this timeline all bets are off. Nobody is safe. 
Since 2020 PuppyCat has been combing through the aftermath, stockpiling tracks, collecting dubs, and leveling dancefloors at festivals like Shambhala, Wicked Woods, Altitude, Spirit Moon and Chrysalis. Summer 2023 they played the official Shambhala pre-party in Nelson, and had their Calgary debut with dubstep heavy hitters Ternion Sound.
Bring your gunfingers theyâ€™ll provide the ammo.
