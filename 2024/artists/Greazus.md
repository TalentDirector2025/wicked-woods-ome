Longtime friends, and well-established producer/DJs HxdB and Patrik Cure joined forces to form GREAZUS back in 2014, and they immediately knew that they were on a special journey together. Now, nearly a decade in, they have distilled their studio synergy, tireless work ethic, plus their shared passion and love for music into their creations and performances. They are considered at the forefront of underground electronic music in Canada, eschewing trends and blazing their own sonic trail. They delight in sharing their ever-evolving sounds with audiences and their sets are intense, high energy affairs, aimed squarely at the dancefloor.
GREAZUS’ musical output is a hybrid blend of many influences, including UK Hardcore, Rave, Electro, Jungle, Footwork, Drum & Bass and Grime.  Boasting releases on top labels like Hospital, Tru Thoughts, Exit and Critical, plus underground heavyweights Defrostatica, Club Designs, Elastic Rhythms, Diffrent, Vandal and Deviant, plus Cure’s imprint, Aufect.
They are renowned for collaborating with other producers like: Fixate, Sinistarr, Shield, Samurai Breaks, Abstrakt Sonance, Doctor Jeep and HomeSick. They’ve also collaborated with the vocalists; Magugu, Redders, MC Irah, Killa P,  Vandull, Emotionz, Sammy Rich and Klose.
They have performed at top international festivals such as Outlook (Croatia), Lightning in a Bottle (USA) and Bamboo (Costa Rica). In Canada, they’re considered crowd favorites at Shambhala and Bass Coast, pulling massive crowds on multiple stages.  They have received support from artists like Sherelle, Anna Morgan, Ivy Lab, Noisia, Truth, Machinedrum, Alix Perez, dBridge, Sam Binga, Om Unit, Kasra and many more.
