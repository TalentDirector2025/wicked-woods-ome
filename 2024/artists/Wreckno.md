From a small town in Michigan to being called one of “electronic music’s brightest rising stars'' - Wreckno has continued to create a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community in the Bass Music/EDM genre. The queer rapper/producer/DJ has had an impressive year: landing the cover of DJ Mag North America; premiering a mini documentary with Billboard; playing landmark events such as Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza; label releases with iconic brands such as Four Loko; and music featured in Fortnite and NBC Peacock’s “Queer As Folk.” Wreckno’s pronouns are he/they/she.
