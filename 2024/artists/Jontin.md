JONTIN - newfie noun  Jonathon  Origin: Newfoundland pronunciation JON-TIN   
If you've seen him play before... then you know what’s up! This guy’s ability to read the floor, create the mood and resonate his good vibe & high energy presence… it’s the Jontin effect!!!   
From the western Canada electronic music scene to the LGBTQ community, he's been making waves and there's no signs of slowing down! This East Coast import moved to Edmonton in 2006 and immediately joined the local electronic music scene. Jonny’s easy going, fun-loving and animated personality made him a very popular regular at local clubs and most events. You knew Jonny was there because his high-energy spirit of inclusiveness and humour charged up everyone around him. It didn't take long for Jonny's love of the culture and passion for music before he found himself playing with CDJs. It was obvious the boy had some skills, expressing that same dynamic personality in his stage presence and track selection cocktail of G-House, Tech-House, Bassline, Minimal Tech & of course the remixed tracks that bring you back. 
So, if you see JONTIN booked for a show near you, don’t miss your chance to experience the East-Coast DJ grown from a love of dance culture, a dance floor aficionado… GO!!!
