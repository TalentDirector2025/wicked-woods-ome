JYVY (John McIsaac) is an Edmonton based DJ and Producer who creates wavey, bass driven tech house and is a lover of all sounds that are gritty with melodic elements derivative from the unique productions of South Africa and Brazil. Throughout his music career, JYVY has made a solid reputation for himself over the past decade with guaranteed high energy, moody sets that encapsulate entire dance floors into his own zone. Seamless multi-genre mixing, combined with his refined track selection and interactive stage presence, always gets everyone in that jivey mood. He is currently partnered with UBK (United Bass Kollective), with releases on House of Hustle and G-Mafia Records. With a recent resurgence of love for faster drums and wobbley basslines, John is inspired and excited for future UKG musical forecasts as he continues to jive his way into the Western Canadian music scene.
