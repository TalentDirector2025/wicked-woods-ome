Be Hazzy has been dipping his toes into the Canadian West coast music scene for around 20 years. Attending his Shambhala, at ripe young age of 16 back in 2003, Be Hazzy found himself hooked on the feel good, positive vibes the underground rave community provided. Under the name, Music People Productions (2007-2012), he and a few close friends, helped pioneer the electronic music scene in his small town of Medicine Hat, AB. In the years to follow, they proudly hosted some of Canada’s best OG Dj’s such as: HomeBreakin Records founders Neighbour and Cal Bass, Stickybuds, Mat the Alien, The Funkhunters, Bryx, Deeps, Wakcutt, Neon Steve, Askillz, DiscoFari, DJ Czech, and even Excision and Marten Horger (before 2010 of course). In 2014, he started collected 45’s and got himself a couple of Tech 12’s and a mixer to keep up with his love for classic rock sing a longs and Funky groovy soul tunes. Add years of mixing extended morning sets and keeping the party going until he was told to shut it down or the generators ran out of gas, and we’re met with the feel-good vibes Be Hazzy’s is known and loved for. Today, you can find Be Hazzy feeding off the energy of the crowd, and capturing the hearts of the dancefloor with a sound that refuses to stick to any set of genre rules. Always down for a good time and Keepin the BOOM BOOM ROOM Rockin, don’t miss a chance to see what this legend with play next, cause usually he doesn’t know either
