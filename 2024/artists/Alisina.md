Alisina exists through audio and his lifetime of musicianship knows no borders.
His broad collection of music and lucid blends allows any crowd to be carried through a journey, regardless of the time or occasion.  Originally inspired by the underground techno scene in Toronto, he found solace in the bass music scene in BC. Now he strives to bring these two loves together while incorporating various genres like garage, dancehall, halftime, and hip-hop.  Catch him presenting a genre-bending showcase of forward-thinking bass music, all specially curated to hit just right on the RSC Soundsystem at the Portal Stage.
