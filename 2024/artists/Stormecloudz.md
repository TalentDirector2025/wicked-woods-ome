Stormecloudz “Have fun, Stay Safe, And Don’t Forget your Umbrella.” For Producer, DJ, and songwriter Stormecloudz, these are words to live by. Blending bubbling basslines with melancholic melodies, Stormecloudz balances Odd, exotic grooves with the deeper, melodic side of house music. Stormecloudz blends his Latino-carrebean roots into his sound, with compelling and cultured rhythms.

Between being a co-owner of S I events, True Sound Events, and the head festival coordinator for Altitude Music Festival, Stormecloudz works to contribute to the fabric that composes the British Columbia music community.
