Don’t let the name fool you — Bunny Pancake’s sound isn’t quite soft and sweet. Originally from Quebec, she now lives in Revelstoke, BC where she made her DJ debut a few years ago. Her style is greatly influenced by the Montreal techno scene, which was her first introduction to electronic music. Her musical selection reflects her love for heavy basslines entwined with dark, groovy and tribal undertones. The energy behind her sets is sure to get your body moving!
