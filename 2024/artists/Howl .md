In the still silence and darkness of the night is Howl. As the moon rises, attuned to the shifting subtleties of the shadows her ritual begins. Like the rise and fall of the tides Howl will pull you into the depth and gravity of sound, initiating you on a journey beneath the stars until the first glimmer of light appears, carrying the hopes and dreams of a new dawn. Howl is a sound system Sorceress, alchemizing lush ambient soundscapes, hauntingly beautiful vocals, and expansive synth swells with a variety of bone rattling bass music. Drawing inspiration from dreamy dnb, future garage and wave, down to the darker depths of hard hitting grime and dubstep, she conjures sets anywhere from 50 - 170 bpm.
