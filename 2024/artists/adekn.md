jus' a human makin' memories tryna move people through music :) /ad-É›-kin/ anagram for Kaden I like my bass heavy but I'm still tryna chill so I like to keep it mellow. I co-host Deep Roots Music Festival. My aim is to create a space that nurtures the underground bass scene while providing a hub for visual arts to flourish. Where friends become family, while inspiring creative endeavors, encouraging healthy habits and personal growth. Let's bring each other up, we buildin' a village and bringin' everyone to the top.
