As a drummer since childhood, Chacho has always had a voracious appetite for new and unique beats. Combining his love of global grooves and weighty low end frequencies, his eclectic sets weave together elements of Bass, Grime, Garage, Hip hop and everything in between. He hosts a monthly show on Subtle Radio and resides in beautiful Nelson B.C.
