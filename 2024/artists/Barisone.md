Known for bringing a multitude of tasteful and sexy music to the dancefloor, Portland based artist, Barisone provides a balanced yet diverse collection of tunes that span many genres. Dedicated to DJing since the 90's, he draws inspiration from that era and his love for Hip Hop and Dancehall music. His focus is intimacy and it's clear to any audience that he is most passionate about moving people through sound.
Over the past several years, Barisone has been a staple of the west coast underground scene. Flying under the radar at many of the U.S. and Canada's most popular festivals, while slowly building a fan base one dance floor at a time. More recently, he and collaborator, PRSN have been curating Wake The Town, a flavorful monthly that has proven to be one of Portland's most interesting and impressive dance parties. A true selector, Barisone always delivers exactly what is needed to set the vibe and move the people.
 His sets are vibey, fresh, and his flow is impeccable. He’s a DJ that plays mostly music I’ve never heard before, but always want to hear more of. - Booms and Claps
