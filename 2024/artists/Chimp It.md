Blending the richness of cutting edge electronic music with the depth and emotion of blistering guitar licks and live vocals
Chimp It’s signature move is to keep their fans guessing, as they weave their original material into edits and remixes from their favourite artists and peers, moving through Garage, Dubstep, House, DnB or whatever fresh gems they’ve uncovered in the far reaches of the music-verse.
They have been selected for prime time slots at events such as Shambhala, Wicked Woods, Friendzy Fest,  Arc’teryx Academy & many more. Chimp It has performed live with acts such as Moontricks, Lazy Syrup Orchestra and Kytami & Phonik Ops.
