From the deepest and darkest soul-snatching pits of the inescapable swampy hellscape known as Florida, arose an unlikely glimmer of light... The Sponges. Blending classic scrunchy-faced funk with next level bass house production, The Sponges have carved their own lane in electronic music. Having gained support from artists such as GRiZ, Zeds Dead, Tchami, AC Slater, The Floozies, Manic Focus and Jauz, it’s clear that their infectious sound is the perfect addition to peak party hours.
Due to their deep-rooted love for hippie fests and nightclub debauchery, the duo’s mission has always been to blend sounds, bend bodies, and deliver the most fun and energetic listening experiences to audiences everywhere. After FIVE #1 records on Beatport,The Sponges are well on their way to establishing themselves as one of the greatest acts to ever grace the sonic wasteland known as the electronic music industry. Prepare your playlists for the dukes of disco, the future of funk, the lords of the low-end, the czars of certified bangers, the emperors of ecstasy, the rulers of the rave, the bassline bastards, and the gods of groove as they gear up for an explosive year in 2024!
