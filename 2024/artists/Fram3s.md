Fram3s is a DJ and Producer based out of Victoria BC. His style can be described as a fun blend of UK House/Garage and Sexy 140/Bass Music. From Hosting and playing beach raves on the ocean to opening for artists such as Nostalgix, and Neon Steve along with playing many more smaller shows on the Island and off it, he is no stranger to life in front of and behind the Decks!
