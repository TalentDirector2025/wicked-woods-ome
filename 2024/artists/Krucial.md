Hailing from Kelowna B.C. Canada, Krucial has been playing bass music and throwing parties for the better part of a decade. He is the Talent Buyer and Head of Artist Relations for Feral Arts & Music Festival. He is also one of the 3 owners of Nocturne Sound System; housing the first Hennessey Sound Design rig in Canada! All the years of hard work have gotten Krucial on stage with the likes of Joe Nice, Tsuruda, Truth and many others. Always pushing the boundaries and never setting limits, Krucial is a force to be reckoned with!
