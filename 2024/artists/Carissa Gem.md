Hailing from BC's sunny interior, Carissa Gem has been a driving force in the Canadian bass music scene for over a decade. From the earliest days of rave culture, she has been filling dance floors with forward-thinking beats, drawing upon a wide range of influences to create a truly unique and ever-evolving sound.
Carissa's sets are characterized by their bass-heavy grooves, laced with cleverly-selected rap and hip-hop samples. Her ability to read a crowd is second to none, effortlessly guiding dance floors through moments of hypnotic intensity and explosive release.
Today, Carissa is based in Calgary, Alberta, where she has become a respected and influential figure in the local music community. As the host of What Will The Neighbours Think on CJSW 90.9FM, she continues to give a voice to underrepresented artists and genres, showcasing the breadth and depth of Canada's electronic music scene.
When she's not behind the decks, Carissa can be found collaborating with other curators of Western Canada's deep soundscape culture, sharing tips and tricks for creating unforgettable parties and events that celebrate the power and richness of bass-driven music.
