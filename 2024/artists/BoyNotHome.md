Jaxzen Marion or BoyNotHome is a multi-genre artist and producer from the mountains of Rossland, BC, Canada. In 2021, he started making Bass Music under the guidance of INNOCENT, while also being surrounded by a community filled with other brilliant producers and DJs. He went on to attend Okanagan College for the Music Production and Audio Engineering program to dial in his skill sets. Swiftly learning the craft, he has already landed spots on Spotify playlists such as Tirade with his collaborations. His sound draws influence from genres such as Deep Dubstep, Dubstep, Trap, Hip Hop and other Electronic Music. BoyNotHomes stylistic choices and sound design go hand and hand. With big boomy trap drums and heavily distorted bass lines, his original music and live performances grip you by all of your senses and bring you into his world. In 2022 he played a surprise B2B set on The AMP Stage at Shambhala Music Festival, alongside legends Shlump, Ternion Sound, Truth, Black Carl, Ill Gates, Lita Lotus, Colt Cuts and Stylust. Jaxzen is involved in projects like DoYu Digital where he assists with artwork, operating the label and running its social media. BoyNotHome has become an up and coming artist in the Bass Music scene to watch, gaining support from Skream, Mala, Hamdi, Sicaria and more.
