Muzik Therapy
Muzik Therapy is live acoustic electronic improv orchestrated by turntablist and DJ, DJ PRAiZ. They are a collective of professional musicians, who are highly acclaimed in their respective musical forms. 
Muzik Therapy immerses listeners in a journey of live remixes - there is no hiding behind prerecorded or rehearsed sets! They take their roots from underground hip-hop, jazz, blues, breaks, funk, boogie, New Orleans brass, psychedelic, Dilla, Chicago house, and disco. At any given show you may hear PRAiZ accompanied by percussion, strings, brass, and keys.
The intention of Muzik Therapy is to grow and enhance quality music culture by performing live collaborative improvisational sets, combining each musician’s passion, to create a once in a lifetime experience in every show. A level of experience, for both the performers and audience, that can only be described as ‘Muzik Therapy’.
