This Canadian funk slangin producer has released over 25 tracks since 2019, with support from labels like Breakbeat Paradise, Cuttin it Fine, Render Recordings, Twist of Time, Wildfire Recordings, and Vibe Raiders. His genre jumping DJ style paved the way for multi-genre production, where he continues to push the limits and make beats outside the box.

FunkinRight has also been blessed with funky sets at many amazing events including Burn in the Forest, Curiosity, FozzyFest, Freezerburn, Restart, Wicked Woods, Vibrant, and many more. 
It’s about living right, loving right, and treating people right. It’s about doing what you love, with the people you love to do it with, and always (always) staying funky.
