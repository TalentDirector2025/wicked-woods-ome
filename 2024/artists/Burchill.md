Burchill was created from his passion for electronic music & through his involvement in the Western Canadian music scene over the last decade. He has become known for his high-energy sets & has become a staple on the festival circuit with stops at Shambhala, Rifflandia, Chasing Summer, Badlands, Motion Notion, FozzyFest, Wicked Woods, and many more. He has been dipping his toes into the production world lately with two releases out to date and more on the way.
