That feeling when dance music hits your soul? When you can’t help but feel your problems fade  away and a smile make its way to your face? That spiritual experience on the floor? That’s  the gospel Prayer Handz sets out to deliver.  
Canadian Producer | DJ | MC: “Prayer Handz” has curated a style unique to his own and gained an impassioned following in recent years. In the studio by day,  this  imaginative artist  pulls inspiration from the worlds of Hip Hop & Soul  Music, and blends them with modern day Bass and Tech House energy. This mixing pot of  influences allows each release to be predictably unpredictable; with diversity and creativity flowing throughout his catalogue. In the club or festival circuit by night, his DJ sets offer high  energy sounds, fast paced flow, and some live MCing to put the cherry on top of these  memorable performances. 
Between original work and remixes, his production has earned releases on highly acclaimed  labels such as: UKF, 3000 Bass, Mix Feed, Uprise Music, Cloverdale’s Vibrancy, DJ Dan's InStereo, OFDM, and more.  Some recent achievements have seen “Prayer” top Beatport’s Bass House charts with multiple #1  releases (Sour, So in Love, The Truth), as well as a #1 House Album on Canadian iTunes (So in  Love).
