Benanas has been making waves on dancefloors across the west coast music festival circuit and on SoundCloud with his widely successful mixes for years. With a library full of ripe tunes, unreleased edits, originals, choice acapellas, and a sharp set of turntable skills, Benanas will surely serve up one of the tastiest sets you'll see this summer!  
But this banana ain't green... he's been attending west coast festivals for the last 20 years, and performing/hosting/promoting in Calgary's venues for the past decade. With his profoundly eclectic track pool and unique blend of Bass music, Hip-Hop, Halftime, Grime, Garage, Funk, House, and more, he crafts a vibey flow that has kept crowds moving for years. They are a seasoned DJ, an emerging producer, and a multi-talented artist passionately contributing to the music and art scene that he loves here in Canada.
