Started in Vancouver 2007, the 7 members of SHAHdjs came together with a unified love for drum and bass. Leaning away from the hardest edge of the genre,  and flexing a full spectrum coverage, expanding into Dubstep, Grime, Footwork, Techno and more, they have been a staple in Vancouverâ€™s underground, playing warehouses, afterhours, clubs, and nearly every venue that has come (and gone) over time, as well as festivals like Bass Coast, Shambhala, Wicked Woods and more.  Be it Levrige (J.F. Killah + Erski), Willisist, Vasho, Myles Away, Kir Mokum, or Decibel Point, you can trust in top tier mixing, peak selections, positive vibes, and the best of times from start to finish
