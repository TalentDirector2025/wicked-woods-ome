Elkemist is a multi-instrumentalist DJ who plays multi-genre dance journeys rooted in mystical sounds, supported by live looping with didjeridoo, vocals and percussion. He also facilitates a weekly ecstatic dance in Nelson, BC called Dance Wave, as well as co-hosting regular community ceremonial gatherings.
Beyond dance journeys, Elkemist has also played hybrid live tribal bass sets at festivals around Canada and Australia including Shambhala, Wicked Woods, Chrysalis, Elevate, Tribe Ascension, The Secret Garden and Kootenay Yoga Festival.
Whether it's a midnight festival set, sacred gathering or an ecstatic dance, expect a journey across space and time, inspired by sounds from around the world to encourage dancers to move beyond the perceived limits of their bodies and minds.
