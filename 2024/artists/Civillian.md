Eclectic is an understatement when trying to describe the sound of Civillian. While always staying true to his roots in Hip Hop, his taste and collection have expanded massively to allow him to become a party-rocking chameleon - no situation outside of his scope. Beside his proven taste and wide range in selection, his ability to work in elements of Turntablism into a dance-floor friendly set is what separates him from other DJ’s. Whether it’s the main stage, an impromptu sunrise set, house party or underground rave, Civillian is always prepared.
 2022 and 2023 were breakout years for Civillian, highlighted by performances at Shambhala’s Grove Stage (2022), Bass Coast (2023), Pachena Bay (2022), two sets at Wicked Woods (2022 & 2023), and opening for The Funk Hunters at The Commodore Ballroom. With club performances from Calgary to Victoria and regular appearances in Vancouver, there was no corner of Western Canada or hour in the day where he did not have the people moving. 2023 also saw Civillian’s debut in the US with shows in Jackson Hole & Reno. Beyond the stage his wide ranging recorded studio mixes have created a cult like following on SoundCloud, along with “Blunch'' his monthly Twitch livestream that has run for 3+ years accruing a loyal fanbase. While always striving to entice the dancefloor with sounds both new and familiar, his uncanny versatility combined with the biggest grin on the west coast has truly made Civillian a DJ of the people.
