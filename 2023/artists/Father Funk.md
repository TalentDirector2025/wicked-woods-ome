Fusing elements of Funk, Hip Hop and Disco with floor shaking electronic beats, Father Funk’s unique, genre bending, party rocking style has gained him a cult following worldwide. Always delivered with a cheeky grin and a thunderous onstage energy, his eclectic sets have torn the roof off nightclubs and festival stages across the globe. 

His infamous remixes of timeless classics and dusty funk gems are instantly recognisable, and staples in the sets of countless DJs worldwide, including some of the biggest names in the industry – even getting a mention on Channel 4 in the UK.

He has gone on to establish his own very successful club night and fully fledged festival stage “Father Funk’s Church of Love”, showcasing the very best in funky bass music and bringing together a dedicated congregation of party people under one roof – an undeniably good recipe for good vibes and positive energy.

Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to… Father Funk!
