Killups aka Steve killips has been throwing down in Edmonton, Alberta for a decade and a half. Supporting some heavy talent over the years his name is well known. He found a home with Ram records/Program with his release ‘ yesterday lanes’ landing a place on the Ram records annual 2019 album. Killups plays many festivals across Canada including throwing down on the mighty Village stage at shambhala music festival. Killups stands strong with Edmontons NAB DNB family along with Calgary’s own Runnit crew. We look forward to seeing where Killups will be heading in his career but you can bet he will be making waves in the drum and bass industry for years to come.
