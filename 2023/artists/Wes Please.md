Wes Please has worked incredibly hard to get to the level that he is at, and it shows. Not without its challenges, the journey has forced him to grow and adapt as an artist, leading to where he is at now, the height of his entertainment career. He powered his way through multiple festivals this past summer including Shambhala Music Festival in beautiful British Columbia Canada, blew the roof off at countless club gigs with artists he truly looks up to, as well as playing many other events has grounded Wes Please in the BC Interior/West Coast electronic music scene. But he knows he wouldn't be able to do it without those close to him. The massive support from everyone at Footwerk, The Beatlab, as well as countless other individuals and fans help make any dream a reality. Always aiming higher, we cant wait to see what new heights Wes Please reaches from here.
