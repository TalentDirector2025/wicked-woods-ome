There are few acts on the west coast combining live instrumentation, high energy  and gritty bass with the ferocity and craft than violinist There are few acts on the west coast combining live instrumentation, high energy  and gritty bass with the ferocity and craft than violinist Kytami and DJ/Producer Phonik Ops. They have made it their mission to create a truly unique sound that  would be instantly recognizable as their own all the while drawing on their shared love of Drum n Bass, Hip Hop, Punk and bass heavy dance music.

Since connecting at a festival in British Columbia, they have become one of the most intriguing acts, standing out in an already saturated musical landscape. Kytami & Phonik Ops have continuously built up their fan base with spectacular live shows and an ever-increasing catalogue of impactful music. 

This power duo has certainly kept up with their forward momentum in the past couple of years. They produced exclusive guest mixes for the DnB Show with Rene LaVice on BBC Radio 1 and BeatLab Radio, a weekly Bass music show out of  Bend, Oregon. In 2022 they headlined many festivals across Canada as well as make their UK debut at Bristol's Nass Festival.
