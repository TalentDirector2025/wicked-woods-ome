Originally hailing from Newfoundland, Nick moved to Edmonton at a Young age. With a strong fascination for music he quickly picked up a guitar and found himself playing in numerous progressive metal projects. More than a decade and a half later starting from 2014 his broad taste in music has settled into the depths of the underground bass spectrum under the moniker “ThrdWrld”, With a refined blend of deep rhythms reminiscent of hip hop and the driving force of progressive metal and upbeat Jazz grooves, striving to stay on top of the freshest sounds in 140 while still paying homage to the original sounds that sent him down this path. After providing direct support for a dynamic range of acts such as Chimpo, Fixate, Khiva, Scratcha DVA. After a covid hiatus he came back to the scene under the name Paryonsi, playing the same soulful to deep dark selections but with a more diverse tempo range; and representing Umbral Sound System as one of the main rig operators. If he’s not slinging tunes on stage you won't find him too far away from the rig.
