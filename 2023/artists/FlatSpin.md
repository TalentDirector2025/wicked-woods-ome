FlatSpin is Caleb Brown from Fernie. He may be better known as half of Naturalist but FlatSpin has become more recognized since playing Shambhala last year. 

His sounds are a mixture of deep house and downtempo that have been received by some of his musical idols. Catch both Naturalist and FlatSpin this year at Wicked Woods!
