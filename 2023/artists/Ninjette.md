[Wicked Woods :: Vibrant :: FozzyFest :: DNB Girls]

Hailing from Kimberley, BC, Ninjette has maintained a presence in the Western Canadian electronic music scene for over a decade. She is the Talent Director for Wicked Woods Music Festival, and formerly one of the fearless leaders of Vibrant Music Festival. Over the years she has earned her place as a performer at Motion Notion, Shambhala, FozzyFest, and a wide array of other reputable Canadian events. Proudly opening for the likes of Aphrodite, Plump DJs, DJ Hype, Megan Hamilton, and Rene Lavice in night clubs across Canada, and taking her place alongside tier 1 performers at every festival along the way. Her swift selections are a juxtaposition of deep, dark bass and playful melodies. While Ninjette is a long time representative of the DNB Girls of America and is well known for her love affair with drum and bass, she is also a stealthy maestro of high energy bass house sounds with a particular affection for breaks and mid-tempo. This ninjette is sure to throw down a little something for everyone.
