FunkinRight is all about fun and funky party music, and having a good time. 

High energy DJ with an insatiable appetite for making funky bangers, FunkinRight has released over 23 tracks since 2019, including 3 EPs and several official releases and remixes on labels like Breakbeat Paradise, Render Recordings, Wildfire Records, and B Nasty Beats. 

It’s about living right, loving right, and treating people right. It’s about doing what you love, with the people you love to do it with, and always (always) staying funky.
