Kootenay based female DJ duo BIRDHAUS always bring the vibes with their diverse selection of all flavours of house and breaks. 

With an exciting year under their belt which had them playing local Kootenay parties including The Living Room at Shambhala last summer, and co-hosting a weekly residency with Naturalist at Fernie’s nightclub The Central, these gals are ready to bring the heat this summer on Canada’s festival circuit!
