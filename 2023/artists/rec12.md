REC12 plays rhythm-driven & drum-focused music across electronic genres & bpm. They focus on music thatâ€™s dark, technical, moody, and driving. At Wicked Woods, they'll be digging into the spooky & heavy corners of their music collection - you can expect to hear industrial halftime, techy dnb, and of course, at least a bit of jungle. 

REC12 is the host of SOURCE:UNKNOWN on Bside Radio; a monthly show focusing mostly on broken beat leftfield techno around 100-135bpm. They are a resident/host at Nautilus, a monthly ambient & downtempo night at ANZA. They have opened for artists such as Longwalkshortdock, Sela (of Daega Sound), Grafix, and Westerley.
