Longtime friends, and well-established producer/DJs HxdB and Patrik Cure joined forces to form GREAZUS back in 2014, and they immediately knew that they were on a special journey together. Now, nearly a decade in, they have distilled their studio synergy, tireless work ethic, plus their shared passion and love for music into their creations and performances. They are considered at the forefront of underground electronic music in Canada, eschewing trends and blazing their own sonic trail. They delight in sharing their ever-evolving sounds with audiences and their sets are intense, high energy affairs, aimed squarely at the dancefloor.
