Your friendly neighbourhood choirgirl-turned-DJ, LOUP is a classically-trained vocalist & pianist who stumbled into the rave and never looked back. Their genre-defying sound spans halftime, downtempo and drum & bass, blending dark etherial melodies with glittery percussion and a healthy dose of bass. With appearances at clubs and festivals around BC and a number of releases on the horizon, sheâ€™s primed to take her multi-dimensional sound to a dancefloor near you.
