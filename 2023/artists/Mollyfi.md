Dubbed Alberta’s “first lady of Breaks”, Krista Thibodeau a.k.a. Molly Fi has spent the better part of two decades breaking down the walls for fellow women and non-binary DJs and performers. A three-time nominee for Best Of Calgary’s best DJ category, Thibodeau is also a notable DJ in her own right, bringing her signature blend of infectious and dance-inducing breaks to stages and opening for artists like Fort Knox 5, Slynk, The Funk Hunters, Neon Steve, Smalltown DJs, A Tribe Called Red, The Freestylers, Deekline, A.Skillz, Baby Anne, Featurcast, The Gaff, Freq Nasty and Annalyze. An alumnus of 2019’s Fractal Forest lineup at Shambhala Music Festival, her entry in the festival’s mix series caught the attention of DJ Mag, who featured Molly Fi in its list of 12 emerging artists to watch. Past festival appearances also include Fozzyfest, MEMETIC, AEMCON, Vibrant Music Festival, LEMF, Chasing Summer, Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Jasper, Canmore and Vancouver Pride, Peak A Boom, Badlands Music Festival, Calgary Burlesque Festival and Shambhala Music Festival. Currently you can catch Molly friday nights at Calgary's own Twisted Element Underground.
