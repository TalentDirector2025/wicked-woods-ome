Uplifting, Funky, High-Energy & Good Vibes are just a few words that describe Canadian electronic Producer/DJ duo, PINEO & LOEB. 
They blur genre boundaries uniting electronic, dance, hip-hop & rock fans alike.

With multiple international tours, collaborations with Grammy Nominees and support from BBC Radio 1 (UK), Virgin (CAN) & George FM (NZ), PINEO & LOEB hit a balance of pure party fun and artistic ambition. 

In-demand for providing official remixes to major labels and independent artists alike. Grouplove (Atlantic), Olivia O'Brien (Island) and Canadian pop star, RÃªve (Universal) are amongst some of the latest artists to receive the PINEO & LOEB flare.
