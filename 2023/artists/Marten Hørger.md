HØUSE MUSIC 

Germany's MARTEN HØRGER is one of the leading forces in house music.   
He combines influences from classic house, techno and bass music to create his very own trademark sound, which UK's DJMag simply calls The Future“. As a result, Marten has recently collaborated with producers such as David Guetta, Tchami, Apashe and Habstrakt; and is named the #33 most influential electronic artist of the year by 1001 Tracklists in 2021. 

The music portal Beatport crowns him the most successful bass house act of all time in 2022. In his home country, too, he finally achieves a breakthrough, and the readers of Faze magazine vote him National Breakthrough Act of the Year in 2023. In addition to a multitude of sold-out club tours in America, Europe, Asia and Australia, Marten is a regular guest on the big stages of festivals such as Tomorrowland, EDC, Glastonbury, Burning Man, Shambhala and Fusion.
