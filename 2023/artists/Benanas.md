Benanas is hot off a busy music festival season that took him all over Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. With original productions under his belt, a record label of his own, and a few years off to hone his style on the decks, make beats on his MPC, and sharpen his library, Benanas made waves on dancefloors across the west coast music festival scene day and night. But this banana ain’t green... he’s been attending west coast festivals for the last 20 years, during which he’s amassed a track pool deeper than an Olympic high dive. Benanas has been performing, hosting, and promoting in Calgary’s best venues for the past decade. His entirely unique blend of Bass music, Halftime, Grime, Hip-Hop, House, Funk, Footwork and everything in between crafts a vibey flow that has kept crowds moving at Canadian west coast music festivals and clubs for years! He’s a seasoned DJ and developing producer that can read a crowd and give them exactly what they needed with a creative flair sprinkled on top. You’re sure to get four things when seeing a live set: tasteful turntablism, balanced blends, viscous vibes, and of course, that sweet, sweet potassium.
