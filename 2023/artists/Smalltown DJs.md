The Smalltown sound is fun bass-heavy house music, combining the spirit of Canada's outdoor electronic music festivals such as Shambhala & Bass Coast, with the sound they cultivated at the legendary Hifi Club in Calgary (which they own and operate).   The boys have released music most recently on various labels including Fool's Gold, Sweat It Out!, Mad Decent, Main Course, and more. 

They have played shows across the globe from the Mad Decent Block and Boat Parties, to Fabric in London, Igloofest in Montreal, and Bestival in Toronto. With highlights that include appearances on Diplo & Claude Vonstroke's radio shows, a one-year stint in Las Vegas, the yearly Mountain Magic Tour with Christian & Justin Martin (of Dirtybird) and friends, and their collaboration with Shad & Wax Romeo Boom Ha being featured in the HBO show Girls. 

In 2022 they had original new music come out on Foolâ€™s Gold, Rules Don't Apply, & Night Bass, and a healthier tour schedule to support the latest releases, as they continued to spread their forward thinking sound and positive message to the dance music masses.
