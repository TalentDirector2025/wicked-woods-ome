Denver-based producer Manic Focus is an artist of many talents. As a magician, he uses sleight of hand to pull objects out of thin air. As an electronic artist, he executes similarly impossible sonic acts with his vibrant, genre-defying music. But his strengths lie not only in the musical and magical: what also makes Manic Focus stand apart is his mental triumphs. \n\nManic Focus’ unique style - defined by a hybrid of electronic, funk, soul, and hip-hop - has helped the producer cultivate a fervent fanbase captivated by his immersive studio trickery and vibrant creative spirit - a combination that has led him to performances at festivals such as Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Hulaween, North Coast Music Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Camp Bisco, Wakaan Festival, Summer Camp Music Festival, and multiple opening slots at Red Rocks in support of Zhu, Emancipator, Pretty Lights, and more.

Now, Manic Focus releases his 7th studio album, Never Not Blue, a new full-length project that showcases the producer’s vast growth as a multi-genre artist, including songs with the blues-infected electronic style of his earlier work as well as a wide range of modern bass music influences. Having consistently evolved over the past decade, fleshing out his sound to incorporate new approaches to genre, songwriting, and composition, Manic Focus’ new album is an amalgamation of the various styles and sounds he’s explored over the years. In many ways, Never Not Blue is a career retrospective - a look back at where Manic Focus began, and just how far he’s come.
