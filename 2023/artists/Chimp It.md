Hybrid Electronic DJ/Live Performance

Blending the richness of cutting edge electronic music with the depth and emotion of live vocals and blistering guitar licks  Far from a standard DJ performance, CHIMP IT spends days on end editing and re-mixing their favourite sounds from all genres. Drawing upon their extensive experience in various bands and DJ scenes, they incorporate original material into each show to great reception.  They have been selected for prime time slots at events such as Wicked Woods, Tiny Lights, Arc’teryx Academy, Amissa and Summer’s End as well as numerous club shows at Bloom Nightclub, Spiritbar and The Capitol Theatre. CHIMP IT’s original music caught the attention of Kootenay legends Moontricks who asked them to perform with them on multiple occasions. They have had the great fortune of working with top tier industry professionals Nick Middleton, Adham Shaikh and 2x Grammy Award winning mix engineer Alex Jarvis. Highlights of 2022 include a guest appearance at Shambhala’s Pagoda Stage, a live jam with Dunks from The Funk Hunters after following The Librarian and warming up the stage for Dirtwire at Wicked Woods. 2023 started off with a bang as they hit the road opening and performing with Kytami & Phonik Ops.
