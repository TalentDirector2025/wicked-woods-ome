Hailing from Vancouver Canada, the seven members of SHAH come together as dj's, photographer, VJ, graphic designer, promoters of bass culture and wicked good times. Drum and Bass is a very sophisticated sound, one that is often over-shadowed by it's hardest edge. The SHAHdjs take pride in presenting the full spectrum of dnb, from the soft and melodic vibe of liquid, smoothly rising to the energetic Dub Rock sound into the harder rhythms of Neuro Funk. SHAH stands for Smooth Hard Aggressively Happy, and we encompass all aspects of bass culture: Glitch Hop, Dub Step, DnB and more. But you won't truly know our vibe until you come to one of our shows.

Started in Vancouver 2007, the 7 members of SHAHdjs came together with a unified love for Dum and Bass. Leaning away from the hardest edge of the genre, and flexing a full spectrum coverage, expanding into Dubstep, Grime, Footwork, Techno and more, they have been a staple in Vancouverâ€™s underground, playing warehouses, afterhours, clubs, and neatly every venue that has come (and gone) over time.

Be it Levrige (J.F.Killah + Erski), Willisist, Vasho, Myles Away, Kir Mokum, or Decibel Point, you can trust in top tier mixing, peak selections, positive vibes, and the best of time from start to finish.
