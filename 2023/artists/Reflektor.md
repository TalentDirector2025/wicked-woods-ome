One of Canada's brightest in Drum & Bass, Reflektor has been on fire since linking up in 2015. Tracks on Shogun Audio, Symmetry Recordings, Technique Recordings, and 4NCÂ¥ DarkMode have set them apart and shown a sound with no boundaries. Their creative and original approach to production led to spicy collaborations with North American greats like Dave Owen and Mat the Alien as well as vocal powerhouses Anastasia and Leo Wood. The duo delivers one hell of a package with each of their respective skills which has landed them festival appearances at Lightning in a Bottle, Shambhala, and Wicked Woods along with a slew of club appearances across Western Canada and the US West Coast. Boasting impressively energetic DJ sets crammed with more tracks than you can shake a stick at, Reflektor's roller coaster track selection and stage presence are hard to match.
