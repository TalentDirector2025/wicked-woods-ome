Naturalist is made up of two music lovin' brothers, Sam Moffat and Caleb Brown from Fernie BC. 

They are known for bringing good vibes, their fun and energetic stage presence will make you want to dance just as much as their music does. They each bring a unique style to the turntables and their live sets are made up of various styles of feel good house and disco bangers that come together to create a sound they call ‘Space Disco.’

2019 was their breakthrough year, after winning the Kootenay Music Awards ‘Artist Of The Year’ but their success was stopped short by something out of their control, but the music scene is coming back strong and they are ready to roll with it! 

Bring on the music!
