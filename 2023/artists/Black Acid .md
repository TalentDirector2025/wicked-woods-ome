Obsidian YVR Crew
BassCoast Crew: Cabin Stage

West Coast Island staple and member of the Obsidian label, Black Acid, stays true to the deeps and draws heavy inspiration from roots dubstep, whilst seasoning his sound with a future flavour. His rhythmic recipe includes a blend of deep yet dancey two-step, reggae dub, grime-laden beats and trap-hybrids. Born in Victoria, Black Acid cultivated himself and his sound growing up in Toronto and the West Coast. He established his method for melodies playing conscious gatherings on Saltspring Island and Victoria. Surfacing in the Vancouver scene, Black Acid developed a devotion to dubstep. Black Acid has been DJing for almost a decade and has been mixing in his own productions throughout. You have seen him at Wicked Woods, Blessed Coast, Luminosity Gathering, Sub Chakra, and more
