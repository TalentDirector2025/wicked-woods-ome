Eclectic is an understatement when trying to describe the sound of Civillian. While always staying true to his roots in Hip Hop, his taste and collection have expanded massively to allow him to become a party-rocking chameleon - no situation outside of his scope. Whether it’s the main stage, an impromptu sunrise set, house party or underground rave, Civillian is always prepared. Coming off a breakout year in 2022 highlighted by a primetime slot at Shambhala Music Festival that created a buzz amongst newcomers and veterans alike, festival audiences also saw him on the beach at Pachena Bay, play two sets at Under the Stars, and perform at both Wicked Woods in the Spring and Fall. With club performances from Calgary to Victoria, there was no corner of Western Canada or hour in the day where he did not have the people moving. Beyond the stage his wide ranging recorded studio mixes have created a cult like following on SoundCloud, along with “Blunch'' his monthly Twitch livestream that has run for 2+ years accruing a loyal fanbase. While always striving to entice the dancefloor with sounds both new and familiar, his uncanny versatility combined with the biggest grin on the west coast has truly made Civillian a DJ of the people.
