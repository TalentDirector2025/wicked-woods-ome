From the forest of the west coast of BC Mews was raised in the paws of festival culture. Her passion for music was ignited at a young age and she always dreamed of being on stage. She is now gracing the stages of festivals such as Wicked Woods and Shambhala and events across Canada. 

Her sound is largely influenced by all types of bass music, predominantly coming from the UK along with r’n’b, hiphop, downtempo and nostalgic dance floor anthems from her youth. You can count on her to get your body moving. When she’s not playing at a festival or traveling the world you can find her newly moved to the big city of Calgary, AB.

“Fighting evil by moonlight, winning love by daylight, never running from a real fight, she is the one named Mews”
