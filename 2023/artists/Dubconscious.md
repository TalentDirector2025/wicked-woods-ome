Dubconscious has come to represent both the east & the western coast of Canada. Born and raised in the Toronto area, he attended University in Victoria before spending 2 years in Nelson BC, snowboarding in the winters & working with the talent department at Shambhala and as talent buyer with their venue, Bloom Nightclub. Since then, he's gone on to become a resident of the Living Room (Beach) Stage over the past decade, also turning in 4 years of performances at Bass Coast.

After a stint in East Vancouver, this seasoned selector has returned to the Kootenays with a plethora of fresh sounds and styles â€“ substantial basslines meet a roots reggae infusion, reggae and dancehall intermingle, funky bashment vibes and bass-infused house face off, with elements of classic hip hop and trip hop intertwined, the drum'n'bass and jungle pulse keeping things lively, spacey halftime beats blend into thick dubwise riddims - and it's all tied together with a dash of turntablism.
