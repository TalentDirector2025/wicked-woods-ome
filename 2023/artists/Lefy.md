Lefy’s been Dj-ing since his College radio days and back then it was all vinyl. He’s built a strong dance community in and around Invermere, hosting a multitude of amazing events like Bass Camp, Lefy-Fest and some epic nights at Bud's Boogie Parlor. He has gained some valuable experience from playing the Rock Pit for 2 years and The Time of Your Life Dome @ Burning Man. He’s opened for favorites such as A-Skills, Krafty Kuts, Freestylers, Czech, Ed Solo, Mat the Alien, Small Town Djs, Meow Mix and Hoola to name a few.

Lefy likes to S p r e a d  L o v e  V i b r a t i o n s with amped up, bass heavy, really good music. 
From house parties to big festivals, Lefy's zest for life, positive energy and well-intentioned dance sets are sure to get your Booty Shakin' on the dance floor! Lefy is a resident dj of the world famous Fractal Forest at Shambhala Music Festival.
