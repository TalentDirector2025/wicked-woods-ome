Captivate is a Vancouver based producer and DJ pushing deeply rooted yet forward thinking bass music. The emerging artist’s productions vary from weighty footwork jungle & halftime hybrids to dark, techno infused bass music across the tempo spectrum. His sound incorporates elements of 90s rave music, Jamaican soundsystem culture, and the lush atmospherics of ambient music. Now a familiar name across Canada, he has had the honour of performing on Shambhala’s renowned Grove stage, as well as countless headlining and supporting sets at clubs & festivals across North America. He is a core member of Mystic State’s Chikara Project imprint, and his productions frequently appear in DJ sets from the likes of Om Unit, Doctor Jeep, Mat the Alien and J:Kenzo.
