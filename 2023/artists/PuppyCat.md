PuppyCat is the spectral embodiment of light and dark, yin and yang, mind and heart. The unifying force between Howl and MisfortuneCat. Their love of music amplified by their love for each other.

PuppyCatâ€™s energy on stage is contagious, feeding off one another as their sets flow between their unique styles. Exploring the deepest rumbles of bass, syncopated percussion, and arpeggiated melodies - music meant to be experienced with all of your senses.
