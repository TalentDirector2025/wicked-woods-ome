The man behind Sigma-1, a Western Canada production design studio. Expect music collected from two decades of sorcery in the subculture.  

Back before becoming a visual producer at highlight EDM events across North America, it all stemmed from the music. Expect a cultivated sonic story that tickles the curious. Deeply inspired by post-psychedelic spacious and eclectic sound design.  Where an ambient moment can become a rogue wave and move a full beach.  Excited to soak in the richness of your company!
