Originally from the UK, Pete planted himself in the Canadian scene at a young age, organizing and DJing events led to a few of Calgary's longest running and most successful club nights ever. He made the natural move to production in early 2000s and with more than 20 years experience behind him, continues to play the festival circuit during summer and studio hibernation during the long, cold winters of Canada, making tracks under his name as-well as his house/ garage alter-ego “Bungalow” In 2021 he started Wildfire Recordings as sister label to prestigious UK  breakbeat powerhouse ‘Diesel Recordings. You can check out his many flavours of broken funk, funky house and lip biting garage as well as an impressive amount of free tracks at PETEWILDE.com.
