mr.b  // Shambhala // Village Stage 

Known for his uncompromising blend of jazz and funk-infused house and breaks while dusting off well-worn but forgotten favourites, mr.b consistently delivers a smooth selection of organic beats geared for discerning audiences. His sets are focused on bringing people together in positive ways through music. This comes through in his seamless mixing of timeless classics with future favourites that maintain pop appeal without sacrificing underground sensibilities. Over the years residencies in Calgary and Victoria honed an eclectic style reminiscent of and inspired by legendary artists such as mr. scruff and Mark Farina. A veteran of Shambhalaâ€™s Village Stage since 2008, his yearly sunrise sets have garnered a dedicated following of leftfield aficionados that yearn to lighten up the space with catchy guilty pleasures and 20th-century classic edits and remixes. Other notable appearances include Vancouver Island festivals Tall Tree and Soundwave and numerous openings for live bands, lounge gigs and full-fledged electronic music events.
