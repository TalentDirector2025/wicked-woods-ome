From humble beginnings playing tunes at Zonaâ€™s in Canmore, Alberta, Robbie C has built a name for himself all over Western Canada. Not just your average DJ, Robbie is a dedicated contributor to the music community. Hosting his own weekly night for 7 years in the Bow Valley and out in the trenches on a regular basis as support for many other local scene events and larger scale productions. A big player in the East Kootenay outdoor scene, he has earned his place at many of the electronic music festivals in the region including Wicked Woods, Motion Notion, FozzyFest, Vibrant and Shambhala.

Musically, you can never really know what to expect. A style and flow that is constantly evolving. No genre labels, more like a jack of all trades.
