During the alcohol prohibition that was in effect from 1919 until 1933, Donald Bump and The Syrup Smugglers used to store bootleg liquor as it made its way to the United States from stills in such Kanadian locals as Bump Town of rogues, but during the Depression years, many a costal family supplemented its income by supplying a thirsty nation with the maple syrup and illegal beverages it craved.  Syrup Smuggling is one of Donald's favourite pass times but he will always save time for his other Passion 4X4 Klub Beats, Breaks, Garage and Sunken Low End Bass.  Donald Bump has been working hard in the music industry since 2002, playing over 175 different clubs and special events. He enjoy’s the Western Canadian Festival circuit by frequenting such fest’s as Astral Harvest, The Womp, Vibrant, Fozzy Fest, Electrodeo, Mogul Smoker & Motion Notion. Donald's knowledge and passion for music, alongside many hours creating his sound has allowed him to releases many tracks & EP’s on multiple label imprints including Sheppard Records, Render Recordings, Wildfire Recordings, B.Nasty Beats and many more. Bump’s music has also received international support from top Djs and Producers like Deekline, Shiba San, Se7en Deadly Breaks,  Funkanomics, Dj B-Side, The Freestylers, Marten Horger and The Plump Djs . Being a trend setter in the Canadian club scene has  landed Donald appearances to play along-side the likes of Wuki, Neon Steve, Freq Nasty, Keith Mackenzie, Mafia Kiss, SkiiTour, JPOD, Kytami, Featurecast, Justin Martin, Nicky Genesis, Barry Ashworth of the Dub Pistols and multiple times for artist’s like Phibes, Dj Icey, WBBL, Slynk, Krafty Kuts, JFB, Lady Waks , Stanton Warriors and Many More.
