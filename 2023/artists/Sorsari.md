Alex Jensen - also known as Sorsari (pronounced sorcery) - is a multi-genre bass music producer and part of the Umbral Sound System crew based out of Edmonton AB.  Throughout his tenure as Sorsari, he began to create momentum within the newly recognized genre of ‘wave’ in 2016 having frequent air-time on Plastician’s previous Rinse FM channel which was the start to creating an imprint for himself within this fresh territory of music.  Over the years, Sorsari has been able to create a foundation for himself within the underground bass scene releasing on notable labels such as Terrorhythm, ProgRAM, and Sable Valley, as well as touring across the USA during the tail end of 2019.  You can expect to hear a blend of styles that range from slow and hypnotizing instrumentals, to faster paced palettes of dubstep, grime, and footwork.
