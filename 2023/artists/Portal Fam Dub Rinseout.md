This is always a SERIOUSSILLY good time, watching the community come together and enjoy dancing one last time...until the next time. Pulling USBs from the fam and rinsing out 140 in a organized chaos format, expect the unexpected, strange b2bs, dub sirens, sunshine and good vibes. 
Hosted by (ShittyKitty) (Silloustrator) (Scowl) (Khris Krosso) and (is it over yetz)
Join us as we celebrate another successful wicked woods and say goodbye to the beautiful friends you've made
Much Love
